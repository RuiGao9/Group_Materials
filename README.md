Brief introduction of this repository:<br>
This repository is prepared for our research group to run the [TSEB](https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB) model after the successful installation.

# Model installation
Installation varies from person to person. One option you could consider. <br>
Before the installation, required software are: <br>
- Anaconda
- ArcGIS Pro <br>
Steps for model installation.
- Create an environment which is the same as the one of ArcGIS Pro: copy the environment from ArcGIS Pro to the "envs" folder of the Anaconda.
- Download the TSEB model from the website: https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB.
- Copy all filles (TSEB) into the environment folder you just created.
- Install the TSEB model inside the environment by type "python setup.py install" in anaconda prompt. Be carefull, you need to navigate to that environment folder path.
- Finished, and you should be good to run TSEB models.

# Run model
Instead of the details of running the TSEB model, demo data is provided in this repository.
- "1_Demo_Data", this folder contains image data for you to try to run the model.
- "2_Decimal_Data.xlsx", this XLSX file contains decimal observations for you to run the model.
