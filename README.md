# A Backup Way for TSEB Model Installation 
Subtitle - TSEB-Backup-Old-Style <br>
This repository serves as a backup of the previous method used to install the TSEB model for our research. It is based on the version available at https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB, as published around 2021.<br>
Please consider citing the original work as referenced in the included CITATION.cff file below.
The original setup included two key folders, which are preserved here:
- pyTSEB-master.zip
- pypro4sail-master.zip
```
cff-version: 1.2.0

Before the installation, required software are: <br>
- Anaconda
- ArcGIS Pro <br>

## TSEB model installation
Since much of our research involved working with ArcGIS Pro, we frequently relied on its built-in functions. As a result, we installed and ran the TSEB model within the ArcGIS Pro environment.
Steps for model installation in the ArcGIS Pro environment.
1. Create a compatible Python environment.
Copy the existing ArcGIS Pro Python environment to the `envs` folder of your Anaconda installation. This ensures compatibility with ArcGIS Pro's Python setup.
2. Download the TSEB model.
    - Option 1: download from the official repository: https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB
    - Option 2: download `pyTSEB-master.zip` from this repository.
3. Organize the files.
Extract and copy all TSEB files to either:
    - The environment folder you just created, or
    - A project directory where you can better manage your code and data.
4. Install the TSEB model.
    - Open the Anaconda Prompt, and activate the environment you just created.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` using `cd`.
    - Run the following command:
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
    (Note, make sure you're in the correct directory before running the command.)
5. Install the `pyPro4Sail` dependency.
Follow a similar process for installing `pyPro4Sail`:
    - Repository: https://github.com/hectornieto/pyPro4Sail
    - Or download `pypro4sail-master.zip` from this repository.
6. Done.
You should now be ready to run the TSEB model within your ArcGIS Pro-compatible Python environment.

# Demo for input prepartion for the TSEB-PT model
The flowchart below provides an overview of the general structure for preparing inputs for the TSEB-PT model using UAV imagery. The specific process for generating these inputs may vary depending on individual preferences and workflows. Hopefully, this flowchart serves as a helpful guide to support you in developing your own approach to input preparation.

# Run model
Rather than focusing on the detailed steps for running the TSEB model, this repository provides demo data to help you get started:
- "1_Demo_Data": This folder contains image data you can use to test and run the model.
- "2_Decimal_Data.xlsx": This Excel file includes sample decimal-format observations for model input.
